**Polymorphism** is one of the four fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. The term **polymorphism** comes from the Greek words "poly" (many) and "morph" (forms), meaning "many forms." In programming, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, even though they may behave differently based on their actual types.

### **Types of Polymorphism**
Polymorphism can be broadly classified into two categories:
1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**
2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**
#### **1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**
In **compile-time polymorphism**, the method or function to be called is determined at compile time. This is achieved using:
- **Function Overloading**
- **Operator Overloading**
The decision of which function to call is made by the compiler based on the function signature (the number or types of parameters).

**a. Function Overloading**: This allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but with different parameter types or numbers of parameters. The correct function is chosen based on the arguments passed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Calculator {
public:
    // Function Overloading
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Calculator calc;
    
    cout << "Sum of integers: " << calc.add(5, 10) << endl;// Calls int version
    cout << "Sum of doubles: " << calc.add(2.5, 4.5) << endl;// Calls double ver
    
    return 0;
}
```

**b. Operator Overloading**: Operator overloading allows you to redefine the functionality of operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) for user-defined types (classes).
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    
    // Operator overloading for the '+' operator
    Complex operator + (const Complex& obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }
    
    void display() {
        cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(2, 3), c2(4, 5);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // Using overloaded '+' operator
    
    c3.display();  // Output: 6 + 8i
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### **2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**

In **run-time polymorphism**, the method to be invoked is determined at runtime rather than compile-time. This is mainly achieved using:

- **Function Overriding**
- **Virtual Functions**

Run-time polymorphism is typically enabled by inheritance and allows the derived class to override methods from the base class. When an object of a derived class is used through a base class pointer or reference, the appropriate method is called at runtime based on the actual object type, not the pointer/reference type.

**a. Function Overriding**: In function overriding, a derived class provides its own implementation of a function that is already defined in its base class. The function signature in the derived class must be the same as that of the base class.

**b. Virtual Functions**: In C++, virtual functions are used to achieve dynamic polymorphism. A function is declared as `virtual` in the base class, and when it is overridden in the derived class, the version of the function called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type, even if the object is being accessed through a base class pointer/reference.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    // Virtual function
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Overriding the base class function
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    // Overriding the base class function
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Cat meows" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;
    
    Dog dog;
    Cat cat;
    // Base class pointer pointing to Dog object
    animalPtr = &dog;
    animalPtr->sound();  // Output: Dog barks
    
    // Base class pointer pointing to Cat object
    animalPtr = &cat;
    animalPtr->sound();  // Output: Cat meows
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Key Concepts of Polymorphism**

1. **Function Overloading vs. Function Overriding**:
    
    - **Overloading**: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters within the same class. This is compile-time polymorphism.
    - **Overriding**: Redefining a function in a derived class that was defined in the base class. This is run-time polymorphism.
2. **Virtual Functions**: A function in the base class is declared as `virtual` to enable overriding in derived classes. The correct version of the function (base or derived) is chosen at runtime based on the type of object pointed to, not the type of pointer.
    
3. **Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes**: A **pure virtual function** is a function with no implementation in the base class and is declared with `= 0`. A class with one or more pure virtual functions becomes an **abstract class** and cannot be instantiated. Derived classes must implement the pure virtual functions to be instantiated.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    // Pure virtual function
    virtual void draw() = 0;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << endl;
    }
};
```

### **Advantages of Polymorphism**

- **Flexibility**: Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions, making it easier to manage and expand the codebase.
- **Code Reusability**: A common interface is shared, reducing redundancy and allowing derived classes to implement or override the common behavior.
- **Maintainability**: Changes made to the base class are automatically applied to derived classes, making it easier to manage large systems.

### **Disadvantages of Polymorphism**

- **Performance Overhead**: Virtual functions and run-time binding can introduce slight overhead due to dynamic dispatch.
- **Complexity**: Polymorphism can introduce complexity when trying to debug or understand which method is called, especially in large hierarchies.

# Friend Function and Friend Class
In C++, both **friend functions** and **friend classes** are used to grant access to private and protected members of a class. They allow certain functions or entire classes to access the internal data of another class, thereby enhancing flexibility in certain situations. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at both concepts:

### **Friend Function**

#### **Definition**

A **friend function** is a non-member function that has access to the private and protected members of a class. It is declared within the class using the `friend` keyword.

#### **Key Characteristics**

- **Not a Member**: Friend functions are not part of the class; they do not have a `this` pointer.
- **Access**: They can access private and protected members of the class they are friends with.
- **Declaration**: Must be declared inside the class definition.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
private:
    double length;

public:
    Box(double l) : length(l) {}

    // Friend function declaration
    friend double getLength(Box b);
};

// Friend function definition
double getLength(Box b) {
    return b.length; // Accessing private member length
}

int main() {
    Box box(5.0);
    cout << "Length of the box: " << getLength(box) << endl; // Output: 5
    return 0;
}
```
### **Friend Class**

#### **Definition**

A **friend class** is a class that has access to the private and protected members of another class. It is declared within the class using the `friend` keyword.

#### **Key Characteristics**

- **Full Access**: A friend class can access all members (both private and protected) of the class that declares it as a friend.
- **Useful for Relationships**: This is particularly useful when two classes are closely related and one class needs to access the internals of another class.
- **Declaration**: Must be declared inside the class definition.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box; // Forward declaration

class BoxManager {
public:
    void showLength(Box& b);
};

class Box {
private:
    double length;

public:
    Box(double l) : length(l) {}

    // Friend class declaration
    friend class BoxManager; // BoxManager is a friend of Box
};

// Friend class method definition
void BoxManager::showLength(Box& b) {
    cout << "Length of the box: " << b.length << endl; // Accessing private member length
}

int main() {
    Box box(5.0);
    BoxManager manager;
    manager.showLength(box); // Output: Length of the box: 5
    return 0;
}
```
