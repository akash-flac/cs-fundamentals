# Introduction

**Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java and Python) are multi-paradigm and support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming"), [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming") and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming").

![[Advantages_of_OOP .webp]]

   a) Simplifying debugging 

   b) Harnessing code reusability for enhanced efficiency 

   c) Amplifying productivity through OOP practices 

   d) Streamlining data management to reduce redundancy 

   e) Embracing code flexibility for adaptable solutions 

   f) Problem-solving capabilities 

   g) Enhanced security measures 

   h) Improved code structuring and organization

## Disadvantages

1. **Steep learning curve**: The thought process involved in object-oriented programming may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it. It is complex to create programs based on interaction of objects. Some of the key programming techniques, such as inheritance and polymorphism, can be challenging to comprehend initially.
2. **Larger program size**: Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code than procedural programs.
3. **Slower programs**: Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedure-based programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
4. **Not suitable for all types of problems**: There are problems that lend themselves well to functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs.

# Further Concepts
## Classes and Objects
In object-oriented terminology, a class is a template for defining objects. It specifies the names and types of variables that can exist in an object, as well as "methods"--procedures for operating on those variables. A class can be thought of as a "type", with the objects being a "variable" of that type. 

A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.
