# Introduction

**Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java and Python) are multi-paradigm and support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming"), [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming") and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming").

## History
OOP was developed in the 1960s, primarily through the work of Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard, who created **Simula** (1967), the first language to support object-oriented principles. The idea grew out of a need to simulate real-world entities and behaviors in software, rather than treating everything as mere data structures and functions, as in procedural programming.

Later, **Smalltalk** in the 1970s fully embraced the OOP concept, and it became more widespread with languages like **C++** in the 1980s and **Java** in the 1990s.
## Need
- **Modularity and Reusability**: By encapsulating data and methods within objects, you can create self-contained modules that can be reused across different parts of a program or even in different programs.
    
- **Maintainability**: OOP code is easier to maintain and modify because classes can be updated independently without affecting the entire codebase.
    
- **Scalability**: Large-scale projects benefit from OOP because new functionality can be added easily by creating new classes or extending existing ones.
    
- **Modeling Real-World Problems**: OOP maps closely to real-world entities. For example, objects like `Person`, `Car`, or `Book` directly represent tangible items or ideas.
    
- **Code Organization**: OOP helps organize code logically through the use of classes and objects, making it easier to manage, especially in complex applications.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was developed to address several drawbacks inherent in procedural programming. Below are the main drawbacks of procedural programming and how OOP overcomes them:

### **1. Lack of Encapsulation**

- **Procedural Programming**: In procedural programming, data and functions are separate. The data is often exposed to the entire program, making it more vulnerable to unintended modification. There’s no clear mechanism to control access to the data.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP encapsulates both data and functions (methods) inside objects. This encapsulation allows control over access to data through access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `protected`, `public`), ensuring that only authorized parts of the code can modify the internal state of an object. This leads to better data protection and reduced side effects.
    

### **2. Poor Data Abstraction and Reusability**

- **Procedural Programming**: While functions can be reused, they do not provide a good mechanism for representing complex data models. Reusability is limited to procedural functions, and data structures must be manually passed around, making it harder to model real-world entities.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP provides **abstraction** by allowing objects to model real-world entities. Classes define the blueprint for objects, encapsulating both the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that represent entities. This abstraction makes it easier to understand and reuse complex code by creating instances of reusable classes.
    

### **3. Difficulty in Managing Large Codebases**

- **Procedural Programming**: As programs grow larger and more complex, managing the code becomes more challenging. In procedural programming, functions and data can become tightly coupled, leading to code that is harder to understand, modify, and debug. Dependencies between different parts of the program are not always well-defined, making maintenance difficult.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP offers better ways to manage large projects by dividing the program into smaller, self-contained objects. These objects are easier to manage, modify, and extend individually. The modular nature of OOP code helps in organizing complex applications, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.
    

### **4. Lack of Code Reusability Through Inheritance**

- **Procedural Programming**: Code reuse is limited to functions. If you want to extend or reuse functionality, you often need to rewrite or copy-paste code, leading to duplication and maintenance issues. There's no inherent mechanism for extending or reusing data structures and their associated behaviors.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP introduces **inheritance**, which allows one class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent). This mechanism encourages code reuse and prevents redundancy. New classes can be built on top of existing ones, adding or modifying behaviors without rewriting code.
    

### **5. Poor Flexibility and Polymorphism**

- **Procedural Programming**: In procedural programming, if-else statements or switch-case blocks are often used to handle different behaviors for different data types or cases. This approach can lead to rigid, hard-to-maintain code when there are many cases to handle.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP provides **polymorphism**, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. Methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide different behaviors, which improves flexibility and simplifies code. This reduces the need for complex conditionals and enhances the extensibility of the code.
    

### **6. Tightly Coupled Code**

- **Procedural Programming**: Procedural programs often have tightly coupled code, where changes in one part of the program require modifications in multiple other parts. This is because there is no clear separation between data and functions, leading to a lack of modularity.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP promotes **loose coupling** by separating concerns. Each object manages its own data and methods, and interaction between objects occurs through well-defined interfaces. This reduces interdependencies and allows developers to make changes to one part of the system without affecting the entire program.
    

### **7. No Natural Way to Model Real-World Entities**

- **Procedural Programming**: In procedural programming, real-world entities are hard to model naturally. Complex data structures must be manually created, and relationships between them are often not intuitive. This makes it difficult to map real-world scenarios into code.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP models real-world entities directly through objects and classes. Classes represent entities with both properties and behaviors, making it easier to map real-world systems into the software. Relationships between entities, such as inheritance and composition, are naturally expressed in OOP, providing a more intuitive and structured way to represent complex systems.
    

### **8. Limited Extensibility**

- **Procedural Programming**: Extending a procedural program usually requires modifying existing functions or adding new ones. This can be difficult and error-prone, especially when the program grows in size. There’s no clear mechanism for adding new features without disrupting the existing code.
    
- **OOP Solution**: OOP allows easy extensibility through inheritance and composition. New features can be added by creating new classes that extend existing ones or by composing new objects without altering the existing system. This modularity makes it easier to introduce new functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.
    

### **Summary of Key Drawbacks of Procedural Programming vs OOP Solutions**

|**Drawback in Procedural Programming**|**OOP Solution**|
|---|---|
|Lack of Encapsulation|Encapsulation through classes and access control (public/private)|
|Poor Data Abstraction|Abstraction through classes that model real-world entities|
|Difficulty Managing Large Codebases|Modular code organization with self-contained objects|
|Limited Code Reuse|Inheritance allows reusability and extension of existing classes|
|Lack of Flexibility (Polymorphism)|Polymorphism provides flexibility in handling different objects|
|Tightly Coupled Code|Loose coupling between objects through interfaces and encapsulation|
|No Natural Way to Model Real-World Entities|Objects model entities with attributes and behaviors|
|Limited Extensibility|Extensibility through inheritance and composition|

In conclusion, OOP provides more modularity, flexibility, and abstraction compared to procedural programming, making it better suited for large, complex applications that require high maintainability and scalability.
## Disadvantages

1. **Steep learning curve**: The thought process involved in object-oriented programming may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it. It is complex to create programs based on interaction of objects. Some of the key programming techniques, such as inheritance and polymorphism, can be challenging to comprehend initially.
2. **Larger program size**: Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code than procedural programs.
3. **Slower programs**: Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedure-based programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
4. **Not suitable for all types of problems**: There are problems that lend themselves well to functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs.

## Use Cases 
OOP is widely used in various domains:

- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**: Components like buttons, windows, and text fields are often represented as objects in OOP.
- **Game Development**: Characters, game states, levels, and environments are modeled as objects.
- **Software Engineering**: Large applications like operating systems (Windows, macOS), enterprise-level software (banking systems), and web applications use OOP extensively.
- **Mobile Apps**: Modern frameworks like Android and iOS use OOP concepts.
- **Simulations**: Simulating complex real-world processes (e.g., in scientific research or business modeling) often uses OOP principles.

## Other programming paradigms
There are several other programming paradigms besides Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), each with different approaches to solving problems. Below is an overview of the most common programming paradigms and a comparison with OOP.

### **1. Procedural Programming**

**Overview**: Procedural programming (also called imperative programming) is one of the oldest and most widely used paradigms. It is based on a structured, step-by-step approach where the program is built as a sequence of instructions or procedures (also known as functions or subroutines). Each procedure performs a specific task and can be reused multiple times.

**Key Characteristics**:

- Code is organized into procedures (functions).
- Variables store data and are manipulated by procedures.
- Focuses on _how_ the program should solve the problem (sequence of instructions).
- Commonly used in languages like **C**, **Pascal**, **Fortran**, and **BASIC**.

**Comparison with OOP**:

- **Modularity**: Both paradigms support modularity (using functions in procedural programming and classes in OOP), but OOP goes further by bundling data and methods together in objects, which leads to better encapsulation.
- **State Management**: In procedural programming, state is often managed through global variables or function parameters. In OOP, state is encapsulated within objects.
- **Reusability**: OOP provides better support for code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism, whereas procedural programming relies on code reuse through functions only.
- **Complexity**: OOP may introduce more complexity due to the use of objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, while procedural programming remains simpler and is easier to understand for small projects.

### **2. Functional Programming**

**Overview**: Functional programming is a paradigm where programs are built by applying and composing functions. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. Functional programs emphasize immutability and side-effect-free functions (pure functions).

**Key Characteristics**:

- Functions are first-class citizens (functions can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, or assigned to variables).
- Focuses on _what_ the program should compute rather than how (declarative style).
- Avoids mutable data and side effects (pure functions).
- Examples of functional languages include **Haskell**, **Erlang**, **Lisp**, and **Scala**. Modern languages like **JavaScript** and **Python** also support functional programming.

**Comparison with OOP**:

- **Immutability**: Functional programming emphasizes immutability, meaning that once a value is set, it cannot change. OOP, on the other hand, allows mutable objects.
- **State and Side Effects**: OOP typically allows objects to change state over time (e.g., a `Car` object’s mileage increases). Functional programming avoids changing state, making it easier to reason about programs and avoid side effects.
- **Modularity and Reusability**: Functional programming provides strong support for modularity through higher-order functions (functions that operate on other functions). OOP achieves modularity through classes and inheritance. However, functional programming emphasizes composition over inheritance.
- **Concurrency**: Functional programming is more suited for concurrent and parallel programming because of its emphasis on immutability and the absence of side effects. In OOP, mutable state can complicate concurrent programming.
- **Learning Curve**: Functional programming can be harder to learn for developers familiar with imperative or OOP paradigms due to concepts like higher-order functions, recursion, and immutability.

### **3. Declarative Programming**

**Overview**: Declarative programming is a paradigm where the programmer specifies _what_ the program should accomplish without explicitly outlining _how_ to do it. It focuses on defining the desired result rather than the steps to achieve it. Examples of declarative programming include SQL queries and HTML for web page structure.

**Key Characteristics**:

- Declarative style: programmers specify _what_ needs to be done, and the underlying system determines _how_ to do it.
- No explicit control flow (no loops, conditionals, or variables are used to control execution).
- Examples of declarative languages include **SQL** (for databases), **HTML/CSS** (for web design), and **Prolog** (for logic programming).

**Comparison with OOP**:

- **Control Flow**: OOP (and imperative programming in general) gives the programmer control over the flow of execution, using loops, conditionals, and method calls. Declarative programming abstracts away control flow, allowing the system to determine the best way to execute the program.
- **Use Cases**: OOP is better suited for applications where complex interactions between objects and state are required, like in game development or GUIs. Declarative programming is more suited for domains where the programmer focuses on describing the desired output (e.g., querying a database).
- **Abstraction Level**: Declarative programming provides a higher level of abstraction compared to OOP, as it abstracts away the implementation details.
- **Performance**: In OOP, the programmer has more control over optimization. Declarative programming may be less efficient in some cases because the system decides how to execute the code.

### **4. Logic Programming**

**Overview**: Logic programming is a paradigm based on formal logic. Programs are written as sets of logical statements, and the execution involves querying these statements to find answers that satisfy certain conditions. The best-known logic programming language is **Prolog**.

**Key Characteristics**:

- Focuses on facts and rules (logic-based approach).
- Execution is about querying the program to find solutions that satisfy the given rules.
- Uses formal logic (Predicate logic or Propositional logic) to represent knowledge.

**Comparison with OOP**:

- **Execution Model**: In OOP, the program executes by calling methods on objects in a sequence. In logic programming, execution happens by making queries to find values that satisfy logical conditions.
- **Problem Solving**: Logic programming is suitable for problems that can be expressed declaratively, such as puzzles, natural language processing, and AI, while OOP is more suited for applications that involve modeling real-world objects and interactions.
- **State Management**: OOP allows for mutable state and complex interactions between objects. Logic programming is stateless and uses logical inference rather than maintaining object state.
- **Learning Curve**: Logic programming can be challenging for those who are used to thinking in terms of objects and methods. It requires a different mindset, focusing on formal logic and rules rather than object interaction.

### **5. Event-Driven Programming**

**Overview**: Event-driven programming is a paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events, such as user actions (clicks, key presses) or messages from other programs (interrupts). It’s widely used in the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and real-time systems.

**Key Characteristics**:

- The program responds to external events rather than following a fixed sequence of operations.
- Event handlers are functions or methods that are triggered by specific events.
- Used in languages like **JavaScript** (for web development), **Java** (for Android apps), and **C#** (for Windows applications).

**Comparison with OOP**:

- **Flow Control**: OOP can incorporate event-driven programming by using objects to represent event handlers and GUI components. Event-driven programming focuses on reacting to events, while OOP focuses on modeling objects and their interactions.
- **Use Case**: Event-driven programming is highly suited for applications that require interaction with users or systems, such as web applications and GUIs. OOP can be used to build these systems but is not inherently event-driven.
- **Abstraction**: OOP provides abstraction through objects, while event-driven programming abstracts the flow of control by responding to external events.
- **Integration**: OOP and event-driven programming are often combined, as objects can represent event handlers and application components.

# Further Concepts
## Classes and Objects
In object-oriented terminology, a class is a template for defining objects. It specifies the names and types of variables that can exist in an object, as well as "methods"--procedures for operating on those variables. A class can be thought of as a "type", with the objects being a "variable" of that type. 

A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.


## Access Modifiers
**Access modifiers** are keywords used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to set the accessibility or visibility of classes, methods, and attributes (fields) within a class. They determine which parts of the code can access or modify these members. Access modifiers help enforce **encapsulation**, one of the core principles of OOP, by controlling access to an object’s internal state.
![[Pasted image 20241009122912.png]]
## Getter and Setter
**Getters** and **setters** are methods used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to control access to the private attributes of a class. They provide a way to read (`getter`) or modify (`setter`) the values of private attributes, ensuring **encapsulation** while giving controlled access to the internal state of an object.
### **Why Use Getters and Setters?**

1. **Encapsulation**: They protect direct access to the attributes of a class and allow controlled access to the data.
2. **Validation**: Setters can include validation logic before modifying the data, ensuring that only valid values are assigned.
3. **Consistency**: They provide a consistent interface for accessing and modifying data, even if the internal representation changes.
4. **Read-Only or Write-Only Access**: You can control whether an attribute is readable or writable by only implementing a getter or a setter.
### **Structure of Getters and Setters**

#### 1. Getter
- A **getter** method is used to retrieve the value of a private attribute. It is typically named with the prefix `get` followed by the attribute name.
#### 2. Setter
- A **setter** method is used to modify the value of a private attribute. It is typically named with the prefix `set` followed by the attribute name.

## Size of class
Size of empty class : 1 byte
### Reasons for 1 Byte Size
1. **Object Identity**: The compiler ensures that every object of a class has a unique address in memory. If empty classes had a size of zero, two instances of an empty class would occupy the same memory address, which could cause problems with object identity. Thus, the compiler allocates 1 byte to each instance, ensuring that even empty classes can have distinct addresses.
2. **Alignment Requirements**: Memory alignment is another factor. Even though an empty class doesn't have any data members, allocating at least one byte ensures that the class can be correctly aligned according to the platform's memory alignment rules.
### Padding 
Extra space added to the structure to align data in memory, done to ensure that the data is stored in a way that is efficient for the computer to access and manipulate.
	- For example, a 4-byte integer is often faster to access when it is stored at a memory address that is a multiple of 4. 
	- If the data is not aligned, the CPU may need to do extra work to read the data, which can slow down performance.
	- Different data types (like `int`, `char`, `double`, etc.) have different sizes. To ensure they are aligned properly in memory, padding may be added.
	- Padding can make your structures larger than the sum of their individual parts, which can lead to more memory usage than expected.
Example: 
```cpp
//Input
class Example {
    char a;    // 1 byte
    int b;     // 4 bytes
    char c;    // 1 byte
};

int main() {
    cout << "Size of struct Example: " << sizeof(Example) << " bytes" << endl;
    return 0;
}

//Output
Size of class Example: 12 bytes
```

## Memory Allocation in OOP
### **Static Memory Allocation**

**Definition**: Static memory allocation refers to the process of allocating memory at compile time. The size and type of the data must be known beforehand, and the memory is reserved for the entire duration of the program.

#### **Characteristics:**

- **Fixed Size**: The amount of memory allocated is determined at compile time and cannot change during runtime.
- **Lifetime**: Memory allocated statically exists for the entire lifetime of the program. It is automatically deallocated when the program terminates.
- **Scope**: The scope of statically allocated variables can be local (for function variables) or global (for global variables).

#### **Usage**:

- **Global Variables**: Memory for global variables is allocated statically.
- **Static Variables**: Variables declared with the `static` keyword within functions.
- **Array Declarations**: Arrays with fixed sizes are allocated statically.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int globalVar; // Statically allocated global variable

void exampleFunction() {
    static int staticVar = 5; // Statically allocated variable
    int localVar = 10; // Statically allocated local variable
    cout << "Static Var: " << staticVar << ", Local Var: " << localVar << endl;
}

int main() {
    exampleFunction(); // Outputs: Static Var: 5, Local Var: 10
    exampleFunction(); // Outputs: Static Var: 5, Local Var: 10 (staticVar retains its value)
    cout << "Global Var: " << globalVar << endl; // Outputs: Global Var: 0 (default initialization)
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Advantages**:

- **Fast Access**: Since the memory size is fixed and known at compile time, accessing statically allocated memory is generally faster.
- **No Memory Management**: The system automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation.

#### **Disadvantages**:

- **Inflexibility**: The size of the allocated memory cannot change, which can lead to waste or overflow if the allocated size is not sufficient.
- **Memory Waste**: If the allocated memory is not fully used, it results in wasted memory.

### **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

**Definition**: Dynamic memory allocation refers to the process of allocating memory at runtime. Memory can be allocated and deallocated as needed during program execution, allowing for more flexible memory management.

#### **Characteristics**:

- **Variable Size**: The size of the memory allocation can be determined during runtime, allowing for more flexibility.
- **Lifetime**: Dynamically allocated memory exists until it is explicitly deallocated, which can lead to longer lifetimes for certain data structures.
- **Scope**: Memory can be accessed from any part of the program, as long as you maintain a reference to it.

#### **Usage**:

- **Dynamic Arrays**: Arrays whose size is determined at runtime.
- **Data Structures**: Such as linked lists, trees, and other structures that can grow or shrink during execution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* dynamicArray = new int[5]; // Dynamically allocated array of 5 integers
    // Assign values to the dynamic array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        dynamicArray[i] = i * 10;
    }
    // Output values
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "dynamicArray[" << i << "] = " << dynamicArray[i] << endl;
    }
    delete[] dynamicArray; // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Advantages**:

- **Flexibility**: You can allocate memory as needed, and the size can change based on runtime conditions.
- **Efficient Use of Memory**: Memory is allocated only when required, which can lead to more efficient memory use.

#### **Disadvantages**:

- **Slower Access**: Accessing dynamically allocated memory can be slower compared to statically allocated memory.
- **Memory Management Required**: You must manually manage memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks or fragmentation (using `delete` or `free`).
- **Fragmentation**: Over time, memory can become fragmented, leading to inefficient use of memory space.

### **Comparison of Static vs. Dynamic Memory Allocation**

|**Aspect**|**Static Memory Allocation**|**Dynamic Memory Allocation**|
|---|---|---|
|**Allocation Time**|At compile time|At runtime|
|**Size Flexibility**|Fixed size (known at compile time)|Variable size (can change during execution)|
|**Lifetime**|Exists for the program's duration|Exists until explicitly deallocated|
|**Memory Management**|Automatically managed by the system|Manually managed by the programmer|
|**Speed of Access**|Generally faster|Generally slower|
|**Scope**|Limited (local or global)|Global access, as long as you maintain a reference|
|**Examples**|Global variables, static arrays, function local variables|Dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees|
