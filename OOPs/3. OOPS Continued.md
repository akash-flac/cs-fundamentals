# Static Data Memberss
- They are attributes of classes or class members.
- It is declared using static keyword. 
- Only one copy of that member is created for the entire class and is shared by all the object.
- It is initialized before any object of this class is created.

A **static data member** (also called a **class variable**) in C++ is a member of a class that is shared by all objects of that class. Unlike non-static members, which are unique to each object, a static data member is common to all instances of the class, meaning there is only **one copy** of it in memory, regardless of how many objects of the class are created.

### **Key Characteristics of Static Data Members**

1. **Shared by All Objects**: All instances (objects) of the class share the same static data member. Any modification to this member by one object is reflected across all other objects.
    
2. **Stored Separately from Object Instances**: Static members are stored in a different area of memory (usually in the data segment), not within each object itself.
    
3. **Class Scope**: Static data members are accessed at the class level and do not require an instance of the class to access them. You can access a static data member using the class name.
    
4. **Initialization Outside the Class**: Static data members must be defined and initialized outside the class definition because they belong to the class rather than any specific object.
    
5. **Can Be Private or Public**: Like regular data members, static members can have different access specifiers (private, public, or protected).

### **Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
public:
    static int count; // Declaration of static data member

    Counter() {
        count++; // Increment static data member in the constructor
    }

    static void showCount() { // Static member function to display the count
        cout << "Count: " << count << endl;
    }
};

// Definition of static data member outside the class
int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    Counter c1, c2, c3; // Create three objects

    // Access static data member using class name
    Counter::showCount(); // Output: Count: 3

    return 0;
}
```
### **Explanation**
1. **Declaration**: The static data member `count` is declared inside the class `Counter` using the `static` keyword.
2. **Definition**: The static member `count` is defined and initialized to `0` outside the class, using the syntax `int Counter::count = 0;`.
3. **Shared Among All Objects**: Each time an object of `Counter` is created, the constructor increments the static variable `count`. Since this variable is shared among all objects, the final value reflects the total number of objects created (in this case, 3).
4. **Access Using Class Name**: The static data member can be accessed using the class name (`Counter::count`) without needing to create an object.
### **Use Cases for Static Data Members**
- **Tracking Information Across Objects**: Static data members are useful when you want to track information across all instances of a class, like a counter for the number of objects created.
- **Constants**: If you want a variable that is shared across all instances and doesn’t change, you can declare it as a `static const` member. 
- **Memory Efficiency**: Static members are often used when it is inefficient to store a member variable for each object (e.g., shared configuration settings).
### **Disadvantages of Static Data Members**
1. **Global State Issues**: Like global variables, static data members can introduce issues with state management, especially in large programs where many objects interact.
2. **Less Flexibility**: Since static members are shared across all objects, they cannot hold object-specific data, limiting flexibility.

- `const` keyword: The `const` keyword in C++ is used to specify that something (a variable, pointer, or function parameter) is immutable and cannot be modified after its initialization. It provides a way to enforce immutability, enhancing code safety, readability, and preventing accidental modifications. The `const` keyword can be used in various contexts, such as for variables, member functions, function arguments, and pointers.
# Encapsulation
- Wrapping up of data and information in a single unit, while controlling access to them.

**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and refers to the bundling of data (attributes or variables) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. Encapsulation also involves **restricting direct access to some of the object’s components** to protect the integrity of the data and prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

In simple terms, **encapsulation is about hiding the internal details of an object** and providing controlled access through public methods, usually called **getters** and **setters**.

### **Key Concepts of Encapsulation**
1. **Data Hiding**: The internal state (data) of an object is hidden from outside interference and can only be accessed or modified through a set of well-defined public methods. This ensures that the internal representation of the object can be changed without affecting code that uses the object.
2. **Controlled Access**: Access to an object’s variables and methods can be controlled using **access specifiers** (`private`, `protected`, and `public` in C++). Only the methods within the class (or derived classes, in case of `protected`) can access the private data directly.
3. **Getters and Setters**: These are public methods that provide controlled access to private variables. Getters are used to retrieve values, and setters are used to modify values. This allows for validation, logging, or other processing before the internal data is changed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    // Private data members
    string name;
    int age;

public:
    // Setter for name
    void setName(string studentName) {
        name = studentName;
    }

    // Getter for name
    string getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for age
    void setAge(int studentAge) {
        if (studentAge > 0) { // Simple validation
            age = studentAge;
        } else {
            cout << "Age cannot be negative!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Getter for age
    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student;

    // Setting private data members through public methods
    student.setName("John");
    student.setAge(20);

    // Accessing private data members through public methods
    cout << "Name: " << student.getName() << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << student.getAge() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Example**

- The data members `name` and `age` are marked `private`, so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the `Student` class.
- The public setter methods (`setName` and `setAge`) allow controlled modification of these private members. The setter for `age` even includes validation to ensure that age cannot be negative.
- The public getter methods (`getName` and `getAge`) provide controlled read-only access to the private members.

This ensures that:

1. The internal data (`name` and `age`) are not directly exposed to the outside world.
2. Any modification or access to the data is done through the class methods, allowing control over how the data is changed or retrieved.

### **Advantages of Encapsulation**

1. **Data Protection**: Encapsulation ensures that the object’s internal data cannot be accidentally or maliciously modified by external code. By restricting access to the internal state, encapsulation protects the integrity of the object.
    
2. **Modularity**: The internal workings of a class can change without affecting the code that uses the class. The details of how the class stores or manages data are hidden, so changes to the class internals won't affect external code, provided the interface (public methods) remains the same.
    
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Since the internal implementation is hidden, only the interface needs to be maintained. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code, as the class details can change without breaking dependent code.
    
4. **Controlled Access**: By providing getters and setters, encapsulation allows validation or processing logic to be added when accessing or modifying private data. This prevents invalid or unsafe values from being assigned to class members.
    
5. **Increased Flexibility**: The internal implementation can be easily modified or refactored without affecting other parts of the program. For example, if you want to change the way the `Student` class handles `name` or `age`, you can do so without altering the code that uses the class.
    

### **Disadvantages of Encapsulation**
1. **Overhead of Getter/Setter Methods**: Introducing getters and setters for accessing private data can sometimes add boilerplate code, especially for simple data members. However, this is often outweighed by the benefits of controlled access and data protection.
2. **Performance Overhead**: In cases where high performance is required, using getters and setters instead of direct access may introduce a slight performance overhead, though modern compilers often optimize away this cost.

### **Access Specifiers and Encapsulation**

In C++, encapsulation is achieved using **access specifiers**. These control which parts of a class are accessible from outside the class.
- **private**: Members are accessible only within the class and its friends. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
- **protected**: Members are accessible within the class, its derived (child) classes, and its friends.
- **public**: Members are accessible from anywhere in the program, meaning they can be accessed from outside the class.
Encapsulation typically makes use of **private** or **protected** access specifiers to hide data and **public** access specifiers for methods that provide controlled access to the hidden data.

### **Encapsulation vs. Abstraction**
- **Encapsulation**: Focuses on bundling data and methods into a single unit and controlling access to that data. It hides the **implementation details** but exposes the **interface** (public methods) to interact with the object.
    
- **Abstraction**: Focuses on hiding **complexity** by providing a simple interface and hiding the complex underlying implementation. While encapsulation hides data and restricts direct access, abstraction hides complexity, allowing the user to interact with simpler, more conceptual models.
# Abstraction
- Displaying the essential information and hiding the details. \

**Abstraction** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors while hiding unnecessary implementation details. In other words, abstraction allows us to represent complex real-world entities in a simplified way, making it easier to understand and manage software systems.

### **Key Concepts of Abstraction**

1. **Hiding Complexity**: Abstraction hides the intricate details of how something works and only exposes the relevant parts necessary for the user. This means users can interact with an object without needing to understand all the underlying complexities.
2. **Simplified Interfaces**: Abstraction provides a simple interface to interact with objects. It allows developers to work with an interface instead of getting bogged down with implementation details.
3. **Focus on What Rather Than How**: Abstraction encourages focusing on what an object does (its behavior) rather than how it achieves that behavior (its implementation). This separation allows developers to change the implementation without affecting how other parts of the system interact with the object.
    

### **Types of Abstraction in C++**

Abstraction can be achieved in C++ using two main approaches:

1. **Abstract Classes**
2. **Interfaces (Pure Virtual Classes)**

#### 1. **Abstract Classes**

An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be a base class for other derived classes. It may contain **pure virtual functions**, which are declared using the `= 0` syntax. Derived classes must implement these pure virtual functions to become concrete (instantiable) classes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Abstract class
class Shape {
public:
    // Pure virtual function
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Abstract method
    // Regular method
    void display() {
        cout << "This is a shape." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { // Implementation of the pure virtual function
        cout << "Drawing a circle." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { // Implementation of the pure virtual function
        cout << "Drawing a rectangle." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape1 = new Circle();     // Pointer to abstract class
    Shape* shape2 = new Rectangle();  // Pointer to abstract class
    shape1->draw();  // Output: Drawing a circle.
    shape2->draw();  // Output: Drawing a rectangle.
    delete shape1;  // Clean up
    delete shape2;  // Clean up
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- The `Shape` class is an abstract class that contains a pure virtual function `draw()`. This means that any class derived from `Shape` must implement the `draw()` function.
- The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes are derived from `Shape` and provide their implementations of the `draw()` function.
- We can use pointers to the abstract class `Shape` to refer to objects of derived classes, allowing polymorphic behavior.

#### 2. **Interfaces (Pure Virtual Classes)**

An **interface** in C++ can be considered a special type of abstract class that contains only pure virtual functions. Interfaces provide a way to define a contract that classes must adhere to without any implementation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Interface
class Drawable {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Square : public Drawable {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a square." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Drawable* shape = new Square(); // Pointer to interface
    shape->draw();                  // Output: Drawing a square.

    delete shape;                  // Clean up
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- The `Drawable` class is an interface with a single pure virtual function `draw()`.
- The `Square` class implements the `draw()` function from the `Drawable` interface.
- Like before, we can use a pointer to the interface type to interact with the concrete class.

### **Benefits of Abstraction**

1. **Reduced Complexity**: By focusing only on essential features and hiding unnecessary details, abstraction helps reduce complexity, making it easier for developers to understand and use classes and objects.
    
2. **Increased Maintainability**: Changes to implementation details do not affect code that relies on the abstract interface, making maintenance easier. As long as the interface remains unchanged, the underlying implementation can be modified freely.
    
3. **Enhanced Code Reusability**: Abstraction allows different classes to implement the same interface. This leads to greater code reuse since common functionality can be defined in the abstract class and shared by multiple derived classes.
    
4. **Improved Code Organization**: By grouping related behaviors into abstract classes or interfaces, the code becomes more organized and logical, enhancing readability.
    

### **Abstraction vs. Encapsulation**

- **Abstraction** focuses on hiding complex realities while exposing only the necessary parts. It simplifies the interface and allows users to interact with an object without knowing its implementation details.
    
- **Encapsulation** involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object’s components. It protects the integrity of the object by preventing outside interference.
