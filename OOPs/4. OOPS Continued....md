# Inheritance 
- The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class.
**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (called a **derived class** or **subclass**) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called a **base class** or **superclass**). This mechanism promotes code reusability, establishes a natural hierarchy, and allows for polymorphism.
### **Key Concepts of Inheritance**
1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows derived classes to reuse code from base classes, which reduces redundancy and promotes maintainability. You can create new classes based on existing ones without rewriting common functionality.
2. **Hierarchical Classification**: Inheritance establishes a natural hierarchy among classes. You can organize classes into parent-child relationships, which helps model real-world relationships.
3. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance enables polymorphism, where a derived class can be treated as an instance of its base class. This is particularly useful in designing flexible and extensible systems.
4. **Method Overriding**: Derived classes can provide specific implementations of methods defined in base classes, allowing for customized behavior while maintaining a consistent interface.
### **Types of Inheritance in C++**
C++ supports several types of inheritance, including:
1. **Single Inheritance**
2. **Multiple Inheritance**
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**

#### 1. **Single Inheritance**
In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from only one base class.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Eating..." << endl;
    }
};
// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Barking..." << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Dog dog;
    dog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal class
    dog.bark(); // Dog's own method
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. **Multiple Inheritance**
In multiple inheritance, a derived class can inherit from more than one base class.
**Example of Multiple Inheritance:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class 1
class Canine {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Barking..." << endl;
    }
};

// Base class 2
class Pet {
public:
    void play() {
        cout << "Playing..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Canine, public Pet {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Eating..." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog;
    dog.bark(); // Inherited from Canine
    dog.play(); // Inherited from Pet
    dog.eat(); // Dog's own method
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. **Multilevel Inheritance**
In multilevel inheritance, a derived class is derived from another derived class.
**Example of Multilevel Inheritance:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Eating..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Barking..." << endl;
    }
};

// Further derived class
class Puppy : public Dog {
public:
    void weep() {
        cout << "Weeping..." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Puppy puppy;
    puppy.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
    puppy.bark(); // Inherited from Dog
    puppy.weep(); // Puppyâ€™s own method
    return 0;
}
```

#### 5. **Hybrid Inheritance**

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance, which may include multiple and hierarchical inheritance.

### **Access Specifiers in Inheritance**
Access specifiers determine how the members of the base class are inherited by derived classes. In C++, you can specify inheritance as `public`, `protected`, or `private`.
- **Public Inheritance**: Members inherited as `public` remain `public`, and `protected` members remain `protected` in the derived class.
- **Protected Inheritance**: Members inherited as `protected` remain `protected`, and `public` members become `protected`.
- **Private Inheritance**: All members become `private` in the derived class, regardless of their access level in the base class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Base {
public:
    void publicMethod() {
        cout << "Public Method in Base" << endl;
    }
    
protected:
    void protectedMethod() {
        cout << "Protected Method in Base" << endl;
    }
    
private:
    void privateMethod() {
        cout << "Private Method in Base" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class using public inheritance
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void accessMethods() {
        publicMethod();    // Accessible
        protectedMethod(); // Accessible
        // privateMethod(); // Not accessible (will cause an error)
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.accessMethods(); // Calls methods in the derived class

    return 0;
}
```

### **Advantages of Inheritance**

1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance promotes code reuse. Existing classes can be extended to create new classes, reducing redundancy and speeding up development.
2. **Method Overriding**: Derived classes can override base class methods, allowing for customized behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface.
3. **Establishing Hierarchy**: Inheritance helps model real-world relationships, making it easier to understand and structure code.
4. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance enables polymorphic behavior, allowing a derived class to be treated as an instance of its base class. This is useful in designing flexible systems.
5. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality can be made in the base class, automatically affecting all derived classes, making it easier to maintain code.
### **Disadvantages of Inheritance**

1. **Increased Complexity**: Complex inheritance hierarchies can make the codebase harder to understand, especially if multiple levels of inheritance are involved.
2. **Fragile Base Class Problem**: Changes in the base class may unintentionally affect derived classes, leading to unexpected behavior and bugs. Careful design and testing are needed to mitigate this issue.
3. **Tight Coupling**: Derived classes are tightly coupled to their base classes. Changes in the base class may necessitate changes in derived classes.
4. **Multiple Inheritance Issues**: C++ allows multiple inheritance, which can lead to ambiguity (e.g., the **diamond problem**) when two base classes have methods with the same name.

### **Base Class**

A **base class** (also known as a **parent class** or **superclass**) is a class that provides common properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that can be inherited by one or more derived classes. The base class defines a general blueprint from which more specialized classes can be created.

**Key Features of Base Class:**

- Contains common functionality that can be shared among derived classes.
- Can have both `public` and `protected` members that are accessible to derived classes.
- May contain both regular and pure virtual methods (if it is an abstract class).

### **Derived Class**

A **derived class** (also known as a **child class** or **subclass**) is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a base class. The derived class can extend or modify the functionality of the base class by adding new properties and methods or overriding existing methods.

**Key Features of Derived Class:**

- Inherits properties and methods from the base class.
- Can have its own unique attributes and methods.
- Can override methods from the base class to provide specific behavior.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Eating..." << endl;
    }

    void sleep() {
        cout << "Sleeping..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Barking..." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog;

    // Accessing methods from the base class
    dog.eat();   // Output: Eating...
    dog.sleep(); // Output: Sleeping...
    dog.bark();  // Output: Barking...

    return 0;
}
```
