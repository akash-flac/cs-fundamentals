# Intro
- An exception is an unexpected problem that arises during the execution of a program and our program terminates suddenly with some errors/issues.

**Exception handling** in C++ (and other programming languages) is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing a program to continue its execution or terminate gracefully. It provides a way to transfer control from the point of error to a block of code that can handle the error.

### **Key Concepts in Exception Handling**

1. **Exception**: An exception is an error or an unexpected event that occurs during program execution. In C++, exceptions are objects that represent an error or other unusual conditions that occur during the execution of a program.

2. **Throwing an Exception**: When an error occurs, an exception is "thrown" using the `throw` keyword, which signals that something has gone wrong.

3. **Catching an Exception**: After an exception is thrown, it can be "caught" and handled using a `try-catch` block. The `catch` block defines how the exception will be dealt with.

4. **Try-Catch Block**: This block of code is used to handle exceptions. The `try` block contains code that might throw an exception, and the `catch` block defines what to do when an exception is thrown.

### **Syntax of Exception Handling**

```cpp
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (exception_type e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}
```

### **Example of Exception Handling in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int numerator, denominator;
    cout << "Enter numerator: ";
    cin >> numerator;
    cout << "Enter denominator: ";
    cin >> denominator;

    try {
        if (denominator == 0) {
            throw "Division by zero error!";
        }
        else {
            cout << "Result: " << numerator / denominator << endl;
        }
    } catch (const char* e) {
        // Catching the exception
        cout << "Exception occurred: " << e << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Example:**
1. **Input**: The user is prompted to enter a numerator and denominator.
2. **Throwing an Exception**: If the denominator is zero, an exception is thrown using `throw "Division by zero error!"`.
3. **Catching the Exception**: The thrown exception is caught by the `catch` block, and a message is displayed to the user: `"Exception occurred: Division by zero error!"`.
4. **Graceful Handling**: The program does not crash. Instead, it handles the error and continues its execution or exits cleanly.

### **Exception Propagation**

When an exception is thrown in a function, if that function doesn't have a `catch` block, the exception will propagate up the call stack until it finds a `catch` block that can handle it.

### **Catching Multiple Exceptions**

You can catch different types of exceptions using multiple `catch` blocks:

```cpp
try {
    // Code that may throw different types of exceptions
} catch (int e) {
    cout << "Caught an integer exception: " << e << endl;
} catch (const char* e) {
    cout << "Caught a string exception: " << e << endl;
} catch (...) {
    cout << "Caught an unknown exception!" << endl;
}
```

In this example:
- If an integer is thrown, the first `catch` block handles it.
- If a string (or `const char*`) is thrown, the second `catch` block handles it.
- The third `catch(...)` block is a **catch-all** handler that catches any exception of any type.

### **Standard Exception Classes**

C++ provides a standard hierarchy of exception classes in the `<exception>` header. Some common standard exceptions include:

- **std::exception**: The base class for all standard exceptions.
- **std::bad_alloc**: Thrown when memory allocation (e.g., `new`) fails.
- **std::out_of_range**: Thrown when an element is accessed out of range (e.g., in a container).
- **std::invalid_argument**: Thrown when an invalid argument is passed to a function.
- **std::runtime_error**: General exception for runtime errors.

Example using `std::exception`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        throw runtime_error("Runtime error occurred!");
    } catch (exception& e) {
        cout << "Caught an exception: " << e.what() << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Custom Exceptions**

You can define your own exception classes by inheriting from `std::exception`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>
using namespace std;

class MyException : public exception {
public:
    const char* what() const throw() {
        return "Custom Exception Occurred!";
    }
};

int main() {
    try {
        throw MyException();
    } catch (MyException& e) {
        cout << e.what() << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Advantages of Exception Handling**

1. **Separates Error-Handling Code**: It separates error-handling code from the main logic of the program, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
2. **Propagating Errors**: You can propagate errors up the call stack to functions that can handle them, which simplifies error handling across multiple functions.
3. **Graceful Termination**: It allows programs to handle runtime errors gracefully, without crashing.

### **Disadvantages of Exception Handling**

1. **Overhead**: Exception handling can introduce a performance overhead, as throwing and catching exceptions can be costly in terms of time.
2. **Misuse**: Overusing exceptions for control flow (e.g., for conditions that could be handled with if-else) can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
3. **Debugging Difficulty**: Errors caused by exceptions might be harder to debug because exceptions are thrown dynamically and can be propagated across multiple functions.

### **Summary**

- **Exception handling** in C++ is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.
- It provides a structured way to manage errors, separating error-handling code from the main program logic.
- C++ offers standard exceptions, custom exceptions, and multiple ways to handle different types of errors gracefully. However, misuse can lead to performance issues and complex code.


# Try, Catch, Throw
## Try 
It represents a block of code that may throw an exception placed inside the try block.

## Catch
It represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown from the try block.

## Throw
An exception in C++ can be thrown using the throw keyword.
