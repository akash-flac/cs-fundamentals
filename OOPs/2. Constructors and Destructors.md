# Constructors

- It is a special function that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. 
- Name of the constructor should be same as the class name.
- It doesn't have any return type.
- It is used to initialize the value.
- Used to initialize a lot of stuff, such as opening the files to import data, or allocation of the right resources, or taking the right step if one of these is not possible.

==Note== : Multiple constructors can be created for the same class.
## Default Constructor
- The constructor that is executed by default.
- It is always present.

## Parametrized Constructor
- A constructor with parameters.

(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/this-pointer?view=msvc-170)

```cpp
void Date::setMonth( int mn )
{
   month = mn;            // These three statements
   this->month = mn;      // are equivalent
   (*this).month = mn;
}
```

## Constructor Overloading
- Multiple constructors are possible with different parameters. This is called constructor overloading.

## Inline Constructor
- Used to initialize values inline, i.e., right next to the constructor.
```cpp
class Rectangle {
public:
    int width;
    int height;
    // Inline constructor
    Rectangle(int w, int h) : width(w), height(h) {
        // Initialization code
    }
    void display() {
        cout << "Width: " << width << ", Height: " << height << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Rectangle rect(5, 10); // Inline constructor is called
    rect.display(); // Output: Width: 5, Height: 10
}
```
## Copy Constructor
- Copy the values of one constructor to another

# Destructors
- It is an member function that is invoked automatically whenever an object is going to be destroyed.
- It is the last function that is going to be called before an object is going to be destroyed.
- Releases the dynamic resources allocated to the object.
- Constructors and destructors call order :

Constructor is called sequentially, whereas destructor is invoked in the reverse order.

This is because the objects are created in a Stack which follows the LIFO order, so when one object gets out of the stack, its destructor gets called. Also, the intuition behind this LIFO order is that, one object can be dependent of other object in case of copy constructor. Eg: for Customer A4(A3), suppose A3 contains one dynamically allocated data, it means that A4 is dependent on A3. Now, if A3 is destroyed first, then that heap memory is also going to be destroyed and A4 will not have any data to point to.

# Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy
In C++, **shallow copy** and **deep copy** are two methods for copying objects, particularly when dealing with objects that contain pointers or references to dynamically allocated memory. Understanding the difference between the two is crucial for managing memory properly and avoiding potential issues like memory leaks or unintended data modifications. Let’s break down each concept in detail:

### **1. Shallow Copy**

A **shallow copy** creates a new object but does not create copies of the dynamically allocated memory that the original object points to. Instead, it copies the pointer values, meaning that both the original and the copied object will point to the same memory location. This can lead to issues if one object modifies the data or if one object is deleted, leaving the other object with a dangling pointer.

#### **Key Characteristics of Shallow Copy:**
- Copies the object’s data members directly.
- For pointer members, it copies the pointer values, not the data they point to.
- Both the original and copied objects share the same memory for pointer members.

#### **Example of Shallow Copy:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shallow {
public:
    int* data;

    Shallow(int value) {
        data = new int(value); // Dynamically allocated memory
    }

    // Shallow copy constructor
    Shallow(const Shallow& obj) {
        data = obj.data; // Copies the pointer (not the actual data)
    }

    ~Shallow() {
        delete data; // Deleting the data will cause issues in the copied object
    }

    void show() {
        cout << *data << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shallow obj1(5);     // Create obj1
    Shallow obj2 = obj1; // Shallow copy of obj1

    obj2.data = new int(10); // Changing obj2's data

    obj1.show(); // Output: 5
    obj2.show(); // Output: 10

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Problems with Shallow Copy**:
- If one object is deleted, the pointer in the other object will be left pointing to deallocated memory (dangling pointer).
- Modifications through one object will affect the other, as they share the same memory.

### **2. Deep Copy**

A **deep copy** creates a new object and also creates copies of all the dynamically allocated memory that the original object points to. This means that the new object has its own copy of the data, ensuring that modifications in one object do not affect the other.

#### **Key Characteristics of Deep Copy:**
- Creates a completely independent copy of the object, including dynamically allocated memory.
- Modifications in one object do not affect the other.
- Generally safer and avoids issues related to dangling pointers.

#### **Example of Deep Copy:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Deep {
public:
    int* data;
    Deep(int value) {
        data = new int(value); // Dynamically allocated memory
    }
    // Deep copy constructor
    Deep(const Deep& obj) {
        data = new int(*obj.data); // Create a new memory location and copy the value
    }
    ~Deep() {
        delete data; // Safely delete the data
    }
    void show() {
        cout << *data << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Deep obj1(5);     // Create obj1
    Deep obj2 = obj1; // Deep copy of obj1
    *obj2.data = 10;  // Change obj2's data
    obj1.show(); // Output: 5 (unchanged)
    obj2.show(); // Output: 10 (changed)
    return 0;
}
```

### **Comparison Table: Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy**

| Feature                  | **Shallow Copy**                                         | **Deep Copy**                                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Sharing**       | Shares the same memory location for pointers            | Each object has its own copy of the data              |
| **Copy Constructor**     | Copies pointer values (not the actual data)            | Allocates new memory and copies the data              |
| **Modification Impact**  | Modifications affect both objects                        | Modifications are independent for each object         |
| **Memory Management**    | Risk of dangling pointers if one object is deleted      | Safer memory management; prevents dangling pointers    |
| **Use Case**             | Faster, less memory overhead, but risky in certain cases| More memory usage, safer for complex objects           |

### **Summary**

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies an object but shares the same dynamically allocated memory for pointer members. This can lead to problems like dangling pointers and unintentional sharing of data.
  
- **Deep Copy**: Creates a completely independent copy of an object, including its dynamically allocated memory. This ensures that changes in one object do not affect the other, making it safer to use, especially in complex data structures.

When implementing classes that manage dynamic memory, it is important to decide whether you need a shallow copy or a deep copy based on the intended behavior of your class. If your class contains pointers to dynamically allocated memory, it’s often safer to implement a deep copy to avoid potential issues.
