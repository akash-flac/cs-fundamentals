# Constructors

- It is a special function that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. 
- Name of the constructor should be same as the class name.
- It doesn't have any return type.
- It is used to initialize the value.
- Used to initialize a lot of stuff, such as opening the files to import data, or allocation of the right resources, or taking the right step if one of these is not possible.

==Note== : Multiple constructors can be created for the same class.
## Default Constructor
- The constructor that is executed by default.
- It is always present.

## Parametrized Constructor
- A constructor with parameters.

```cpp
void Date::setMonth( int mn )
{
   month = mn;            // These three statements
   this->month = mn;      // are equivalent
   (*this).month = mn;
}
```

## Constructor Overloading
- Multiple constructors are possible with different parameters. This is called constructor overloading.

## Inline Constructor
- Used to initialize values inline, i.e., right next to the constructor.
```cpp
class Rectangle {
public:
    int width;
    int height;
    // Inline constructor
    Rectangle(int w, int h) : width(w), height(h) {
        // Initialization code
    }
    void display() {
        cout << "Width: " << width << ", Height: " << height << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Rectangle rect(5, 10); // Inline constructor is called
    rect.display(); // Output: Width: 5, Height: 10
}
```
## Copy Constructor
- Copy the values of one constructor to another

# Destructors
- It is an member function that is invoked automatically whenever an object is going to be destroyed.
- It is the last function that is going to be called before an object is going to be destroyed.
- Releases the dynamic resources allocated to the object.
- Constructors and destructors call order :

Constructor is called sequentially, whereas destructor is invoked in the reverse order.

This is because the objects are created in a Stack which follows the LIFO order, so when one object gets out of the stack, its destructor gets called. Also, the intuition behind this LIFO order is that, one object can be dependent of other object in case of copy constructor. Eg: for Customer A4(A3), suppose A3 contains one dynamically allocated data, it means that A4 is dependent on A3. Now, if A3 is destroyed first, then that heap memory is also going to be destroyed and A4 will not have any data to point to.
