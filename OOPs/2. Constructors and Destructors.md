# Constructors and Destructors

- It is a special function that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. 
- Name of the constructor should be same as the class name.
- It doesn't have any return type.
- It is used to initialize the value.
- Used to initialize a lot of stuff, such as opening the files to import data, or allocation of the right resources, or taking the right step if one of these is not possible.

==Note== : Multiple constructors can be created for the same class.
## Default Constructor
- The constructor that is executed by default.
- It is always present.

## Parametrized Constructor
- A constructor with parameters.

```cpp
void Date::setMonth( int mn )
{
   month = mn;            // These three statements
   this->month = mn;      // are equivalent
   (*this).month = mn;
}
```

## Constructor Overloading
- Multiple constructors are possible with different parameters. This is called constructor overloading.

## Inline Constructor
- Used to initialize values inline, i.e., right next to the constructor.
## Copy Constructor
-
