# week 1
- Definition of Computer (Oxford English Dictionary) Computer (n) – an electronic device which is capable of receiving information (data) in a particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions (program) to produce a result in the form of information or signals
- digital pedometer is a computer, as it fits the definition of a computer
- another example - micro-oven
- User-Centric design - System design should not force users to learn about the underlying technology
- historical evolution
	- 1940s to 70s(pre-history) - before personal computers
	- 80s to early 21st century(early phase) - personal computers
	- 90s to first decade of 21st century(pre-modern phase) - mobile PCs, smartphones, tablets
	- 2011 onwards(modern age) - interconnected devices

- “Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.”
	- core concern: incorporating humans into design
	- User classification of users 
		- Novice 
		- Intermittent 
		- Expert
	- ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241101170746.png)
	- We require an explicit measure to judge our design – if we have taken care of the human factors The measure is called “Usability”
		- ISO definition (ISO 9241-210:2009) of usability - “the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.”
		- Three crucial aspects in the definition:
		- The product is meant to be used by a specified group of users. In other words, a usable product need not be designed “for all”.
		- The product should allow the users to achieve specified set of goals. Thus, putting every conceivable features in a product not necessarily leads to a usable product.
		- The product should be designed for specified context of usage. Clearly, a usable product need not be so for “all” usage scenario.
	- Definition reveals THREE measures 
		- Effectiveness 
		- Efficiency 
		- Satisfaction
	- Jacob Nielsen- acceptable product should have "usability" and "utility"
	- Nielsen- 5 quality components of usability : Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors, Satisfaction
	- Utility = Effectiveness
	- The five components of usability offer a more precise measure, whereas the ISO definition therefore provided only two measures for usability: the efficiency and satisfaction.
	- User-centered design: Shneiderman(1986)
		- Objective - to design products that increase usability
	- ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241101202311.png)
	- ISO in its standards prefers to use the term “human-centered design”
- SDLC: To comprehensively capture and represent design and development activities
- SDLC examples: Waterfall model, Spiral model, Evolutionary model, etc.
- Waterfall Model: 
	- ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241101205011.png)
- Spiral Model: A meta model - encompasses all other SDLCs
	- Multiple cycles (iterations) 
	- Each spiral – one iteration
	- Each iterations – divided into 4 phases (quadrants)
	- ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241101205853.png)

- Interactive SDLC
	- Waterfall model is more system design centric
	- In order to implement UCD, we require highly iterative life cycle

- System-centered Design vs User-centered Design
	- System
		- What can I easily build on this platform? 
		- What can I create from the available tools? 
		- What do I as a programmer find interesting?
	- User
		- Design is based upon a user’s 
			- Abilities 
			- Context
			- Goals/needs 
			- Not only programmer’s convenience
- Non-functional requirements
	- These are system characteristics that can not be expressed as functions
		- Related to quality attributes of the software

# week 2
- contextual inquiry:
	- a method to gather end-user requirements
		- Same as usability requirements 
		- One of many such methods
	- was called "phenomenological research method" in 1988
	- Often referred to as a “semi-structured” interview process 
		- Consists of both interview and observations
	- Primary objective - watch and observe users perform tasks in their “natural” work setting (the work context) 
	- During observations, users may be asked questions to clarify on certain behavior or activities
	- Usually the process continues for one to two hours
	- Observations (including interaction with users) enable designers learn about task domain, work culture and physical and social constraints at the work place 
		- The knowledge is important since the “specific work context” is an essential part of the definition of usability
- CI Types- Two Ways : The inquiry can be performed in either way
	- Active mode: Observer is physically present
	- Passive mode: User activities recorded/videotaped and reviewed later
- During the inquiry, observer should act as “apprentice” and treat the users as “masters”
	- Purpose is to learn user behavior, not to teach them how to behave
- CI - Stages
	- Five Stages:
		- Plan
		- Initiate
		- Execute
		- Close
		- Reflect
	- ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241101223939.png)
	- Initiate: Contact the authorities for permission and open communication with the end users to remove their anxieties
	- Execute: Perform observations and record data
	- Close: Send “thank you” notes to the users (you may require them later)
	- Reflect: Analyze the data collected to identify design goals

- ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241102005147.png)
- SRS
	- When we put requirements in textual form, we get the SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document • The “formal” representation/specification of requirements
	- Hierarchical structure (R1, R1, R1.1 etc) — Each R (e.g., R1, R1.1 etc) represents a function with clearly defined input and output and some description (optional)
